- there an an infinite number of clouds
- the verticle position of the cloud is random within a specified range
- the clouds appear at a distance from each other
- the clouds move from right to left (negative velocityX)
- the cloud should be created beyond the right boundary of the canvas
- when the cloud exits the canvas from the left boundary it needs to move fluidly and not suddenly dissapear
- the clouds need to be created in the function draw
